                        <li><b>Stress and tension:</b> Stress can lead to muscle tension, particularly in the neck
                            and
                            back.
                            Over time,
                            this can result in discomfort and pain. Techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation
                            exercises
                            can
                            help manage stress and subsequently reduce neck and back pain.</li>

                        <li><b>Overuse injuries:</b> Overuse injuries occur when a particular part of the body is

                            to
                            repeated
                            stress over a long period. In the context of neck and back pain, this could be due to
                            long
                            hours
                            spent in a static posture, such as sitting at a desk or repeatedly performing the same
                            motion.
                            This
                            repetitive strain can lead to micro-tears in the tissues, resulting in inflammation and
