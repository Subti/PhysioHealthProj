        <h2 class="my-4"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
        <p>Despite its more commonly known name, Tennis Elbow can affect people across a wide variety of
            different occupations and sports,
            and the discomfort it can cause could heavily impact your daily activities. The good news is that there are
            several effective treatments for tennis elbow, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, braces, and sometimes
            surgery, if conservative methods fail to provide relief.</p>
        <p>Remember, prevention is the best cure - employing
            correct techniques and postures, using ergonomic tools, and ensuring regular rest and muscle conditioning
            can significantly reduce the risk of developing this condition.</p>
